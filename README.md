# Greenthumb 2


## Description

Our new and improved vision of Greenthumb is a social network where users can design garden layouts, share them with others within the platform, and add new plants to our database. This app was built with React, designed with Bulma, follows an MVC format and stores data in a MongoDB database.


## Installation

Type the following into your terminal or command line to copy this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:twohunters/Greenthumb2.git`

Install the necessary dependencies with `npm i` and run the program with `npm start`.


## Usage

At the homepage, users can view all of the most recent gardens created by other users on the Greenthumb platform. Users can create a profile with a unique email and password, and upon signup or logging in, will be directed to the Dashboard where they can view a list of their own created gardens. In the floating menu, users are presented with links to view all plants in the database as well as the ability add new plants, view all existing gardens, and view all other users, as well as their biographies and a list of their own personal gardens.
